# ⚡ Battery Visualization Project

## Overview 
This project visualizes battery-related data using an interactive bar chart built with Python and Plotly. The visualization focuses on key metrics such as **Re** and **Rct** from the input dataset.

---

## ✨ Features
- ✔ Interactive visualization of battery parameters.
- ✔ Ensures necessary columns (Re and Rct) are present in the dataset.
- ✔ Raises errors for missing data files or columns.
- ✔ Lightweight and user-friendly.

---

## 📂 Files
1. **metadata.csv**: Input dataset containing battery data.
2. **battery_visualization.py**: Python script for generating the visualization.

---

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/battery-visualization.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas plotly
   ```

3. Place your dataset in the appropriate folder and ensure it is named `metadata.csv`.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python battery_visualization.py
   ```

---

## ⚖ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- Plotly

---

## ☁ Sample Dataset Format
Ensure your `metadata.csv` follows this structure:
```csv
Re,Rct,OtherColumns
0.5,10,Data1
1.0,20,Data2
...
```

---

## 🔋 Output
The script generates an interactive bar chart visualizing the **Re** and **Rct** values.
